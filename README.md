## Introduction

**NixOS** is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager. It was developed to bring the power of *declarative configuration* and *functional system management* to the operating system level.

---

### ❄️ The NixOS Philosophy

The philosophy of NixOS revolves around **reproducibility** and **stability**, aiming to provide a virtually *“unbreakable”* system through a **declarative** and **functional** approach to system management.

In simpler terms, you can declare your **entire system** in just a few Nix configuration files — including:

* System packages
* Environment variables
* Dotfiles and personal settings
* Specific package versions
* Even your hardware configuration

This makes it possible to **replicate** your exact system on any machine with ease — ideal for backup, testing, or sharing your setup.

---

### ❄️ What Makes NixOS Different?

Key points that set NixOS apart from traditional Linux distributions are:

* **Declarative system config**: You describe *what* the system should look like, not *how* to get there.
* **Atomic upgrades and rollbacks**: You can switch between system generations and undo changes safely.
* **Reproducibility**: Your config can be version-controlled and deployed across machines.
* **Isolated environments**: No accidental overwrites or “dependency hell.”
* **Per-user packages**: Unlike traditional distros, Nix allows users to install packages **just for themselves**.
* **Side-by-side versions**: Install multiple versions of the same package — useful for dev environments.

## Installation

Installation steps can be categorized into:

* Preparation
* Ensuring an Internet connection
* Disk partitioning and mounting
* Configuration generation and installation
* Reboot and password setup

### ❄️ Preparation

As with any other OS installation, begin by downloading the ISO image from the [**official website**](https://nixos.org/download/). The graphical installer includes **Calamares**, which provides a faster, non-manual setup process.

For manual installation, well-written guides are available in the [**official manual**](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-installation) and the [**unofficial wiki**](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_Installation_Guide).

Even if you plan to install manually, I still recommend using the graphical installer initially—it makes it easier to copy and paste commands from the internet.

After booting into the live ISO, you'll have access to two users: **nixos** and **root**, neither of which has a password. You will need elevated privileges during installation, so you can either prefix commands with `sudo` or switch to the root user using `sudo -i`.

**Side note:** Manual installation is significantly easier than, say, Arch Linux.

---

### ❄️ Ensuring an Internet Connection

If using a wired connection, internet access should be available automatically. You can also tether using your phone.

For Wi-Fi:

1. Start the `wpa_supplicant` service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start wpa_supplicant.service
   ```

2. Use `wpa_cli` to connect to your network:

   ```bash
   wpa_cli
   ```

   For most home networks, use the following commands in the `wpa_cli` interface:

   ```
   add_network 0
   set_network 0 ssid "myhomenetwork"
   set_network 0 psk "mypassword"
   enable_network 0
   ```

   For enterprise networks (e.g., eduroam), use:

   ```
   add_network
   0
   set_network 0 ssid "eduroam"
   set_network 0 identity "myname@example.com"
   set_network 0 password "mypassword"
   enable_network 0
   ```

   When successfully connected, you should see a line like:

   ```
   <3>CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED - Connection to 32:85:ab:ef:24:5c completed [id=0 id_str=]
   ```

   You can now leave `wpa_cli` by typing:

   ```
   quit
   ```
3. Finally, test connectivity using the ping command: `ping nixos.org`

---

### ❄️ Disk Partitioning and Mounting

In this setup, I’ll be using the following partition layout:

| Number | Type             | Size                 | Label |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| 1      | EFI System       | 1 GiB / 512 MiB      | BOOT  |
| 2      | Linux Filesystem | Remaining disk space | ROOT  |

Start by listing your available block devices to identify the installation target:

```bash
lsblk
```

I recommend using `cfdisk` because it’s more intuitive:

```bash
sudo cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1
```

Partition the disk as described in the table above. Then, format and label the partitions:

```bash
sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1       # Format EFI partition as FAT32
sudo fatlabel /dev/nvme0n1p1 BOOT        # Label the EFI partition
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p2 -L ROOT    # Format root partition as ext4 and label it
```

Mount the partitions:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/ROOT /mnt    # Mount root partition
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot                    # Create boot directory
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/BOOT /mnt/boot # Mount boot partition
```

#### Optional: Create a swap file

If you don’t want a dedicated swap partition, you can create a swap file like this:

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/.swapfile bs=1M count=2048  # Allocate 2 GB swap file
sudo chmod 600 /mnt/.swapfile                            # Set correct permissions
sudo mkswap /mnt/.swapfile                               # Format as swap
sudo swapon /mnt/.swapfile                               # Enable swap temporarily
```

You can also define this swap file in your configuration, which is the preferred long-term method (explained below).

---

### ❄️ Config Generation and Installation

Generate your base NixOS configuration:

```bash
sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
```

Then edit the generated `configuration.nix`:

```bash
sudo nano /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```

Here are some useful additions to make:

```nix
# Keyboard layout
services.xserver.xkb.layout = "us";

# Add a user
users.users.alice = {
  isNormalUser = true;
  description = "Alice";
  extraGroups = [ "wheel" ];  # Grants sudo access
  shell = pkgs.bash;
  home = "/home/alice";
};

# Basic networking setup (replace with your actual config)
# networking.wireless.enable = true;
# networking.networkmanager.enable = true;

# Configure GRUB for UEFI systems
boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;

# Optional: Install an editor
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ vim ];  # Or nano, neovim, helix, etc.

# Swap file declaration (if created)
swapDevices = [
  { device = "/.swapfile"; }
];
```

If you used labels during partitioning, consider editing `hardware-configuration.nix` to use those:

```nix
fileSystems."/" = {
  device = "/dev/disk/by-label/ROOT";
  fsType = "ext4";
};

fileSystems."/boot" = {
  device = "/dev/disk/by-label/BOOT";
  fsType = "vfat";
};
```

Once your configuration is ready, install the system:

```bash
cd /mnt
sudo nixos-install
```

---

### ❄️ Reboot and Password Setup

After the installation completes successfully, you'll be asked to enter a new root password, enter the new password for the root user and then:

1. **Reboot:**

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

2. **Set the root password on first boot:**

   When the system boots into NixOS, log in as `root` and run:

   ```bash
   passwd <your username>
   ```

   This will prompt you to set a user password.

3. **Log in as your user:**

   If you added a user (e.g., `alice`), you can now switch to them:

   ```bash
   su - alice
   ```

## Configuration

### ❄️ Tiers of NixOS Usage

I like to classify NixOS usage into four increasing tiers of complexity (though you’re not required to follow them in order):

1. **Base** – Standard configuration using `configuration.nix`
2. **With Home Manager** – User-specific config manager for dotfiles and more
3. **With Flakes** – Declarative, version-pinned systems and reproducible builds
4. **With Home Manager + Flakes** – Fully modular, reproducible, and portable setup

This section focuses on the **Base configuration**, while **Home Manager** and **Flakes** are covered later.

---

### ❄️ Base Configuration

After a fresh install, your configuration is defined in:

```
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
```

#### Example: `configuration.nix`

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  # Import hardware settings from auto-generated file
  imports = [ ./hardware-configuration.nix ];

  # Enable systemd-boot bootloader (for EFI systems)
  boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
  boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;

  # Set your hostname (used for networking, prompts, etc.)
  networking.hostName = "nixos";

  # Set system timezone
  time.timeZone = "Asia/Kolkata";

  # Define a normal user named "alice"
  users.users.alice = {
    isNormalUser = true;                     # Not a system/root user
    description = "Alice";                   # Optional description
    extraGroups = [ "wheel" ];               # Grants sudo access
    shell = pkgs.bash;                       # Sets default shell (e.g. bash, zsh)
  };

  # Define system-wide packages available to all users
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    wget       # For downloading files
    curl       # HTTP requests
    git        # Version control
    neofetch   # Show system info in terminal
    htop       # Interactive process viewer
  ];

  # Enable X11 (graphical display server)
  services.xserver.enable = true;

  # Enable SDDM (Simple Desktop Display Manager) login screen
  services.xserver.displayManager.sddm.enable = true;

  # Enable KDE Plasma 5 as desktop environment
  services.xserver.desktopManager.plasma5.enable = true;

  # Enable audio support
  sound.enable = true;
  hardware.pulseaudio.enable = true;         # PulseAudio sound server (legacy)

  # Define the version of NixOS you're configuring against
  # Important for compatibility with older or newer modules
  system.stateVersion = "24.05";

  # Declare a swap file (must also exist physically at /.swapfile)
  swapDevices = [
    { device = "/.swapfile"; }
  ];
}
```

#### Example: `hardware-configuration.nix`

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  # Define the root (/) file system
  fileSystems."/" = {
    device = "/dev/disk/by-label/ROOT";   # Use the device labeled "ROOT"
    fsType = "ext4";                      # Use ext4 filesystem
  };

  # Define the EFI boot partition (/boot)
  fileSystems."/boot" = {
    device = "/dev/disk/by-label/BOOT";   # Use the device labeled "BOOT"
    fsType = "vfat";                      # FAT32 is required for EFI systems
  };

  # Declare the swap file here (referenced during boot)
  swapDevices = [
    { device = "/.swapfile"; }
  ];

  # This file may also include:
  # - GPU or driver config
  # - File system mount options
  # - Detected hardware modules (e.g. for Wi-Fi, SSDs, etc.)
  # Avoid modifying it unless needed — NixOS regenerates it during config generation.
}

```
The generated config file in your system probably has well put comments as well, so i'd suggest referring them too. For a detailed manual, there's always the wiki, both [official](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/) and [unofficial](https://nixos.wiki/) which are written by people much smarter than me.

### ❄️ Quick Guide to Nix Package Manager

Here are some basic commands for managing packages on NixOS:

| Task                          | Command                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Search for a package          | `nix search nixpkgs <name>`            |
| Install a package (user-wide) | `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.<package>`        |
| List user-installed packages  | `nix-env -q`                           |
| Remove a package              | `nix-env -e <package>`                 |
| Upgrade all user packages     | `nix-env -u '*'`                       |
| Run a package temporarily     | `nix run nixpkgs#<package>`            |
| Open a dev shell with deps    | `nix-shell -p <pkg1> <pkg2>`           |
| Clean unused generations      | `sudo nix-collect-garbage -d`          |
| Roll back system config       | `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback` |

> *Note:* With **flakes** (covered later), some of these commands change slightly — they become more declarative and consistent.
